# CollectionSpace Cucumber 
Integration tests for CollectionSpace using cucumber-jvm, selenium, and jUnit

## Requirements
* Java 7
* Maven
* A running CollectionSpace instance. These tests are set to run against an external CollectionSpace instance. By default this is located at http://localhost:8180, however you could easily run it against the [CollectionSpace Demo](http://demo.collections.org:8080)

## Usage
`git clone https://github.com/bibliotechy/cspace-cucumber.git`

`cd cspace-cucumber`

`mvn clean verify`

Then watch all the tests pass.
